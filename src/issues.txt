# Issues
- Need to intialise board size using grideSize variable/state
- Need to add onClick functionality to cells. Adding to string using createGrid() doesn't seem to work 
- Issues with resizing (cellSize/boardSize goes out of sync maybe)

-makeNewBoard(), createGrid(), countNeighbours() take the most time and therfore slow program the most

# Stuff to do
- want to control live cells by clicking etc.
- add ability to click on cell to add object
- make grid square
- change slider colours
- allow rotation of objects, i.e. gliders
